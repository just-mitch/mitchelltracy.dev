# Mitchell Tracy

Thanks for checking out my page and github! The purpose of the page is to:

- Let people get to know me better and reach out if they think I'd be a good fit for their team.
- Demo a use of the Assistants API from OpenAI.
- Demo basic Web3 development and how to integrate it with React.

## Shoutout

The template for the page was adapted from the Spotlight [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
